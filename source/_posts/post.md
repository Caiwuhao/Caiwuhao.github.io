We designed pure heralded single-photon sources at the telecom O-band, where single-photon pulse can be transmitted with low loss and low pulse distortion. Moreover, we have investigated noise photon spectra for different poling optimization methods, we show that, in practice, appropriate, gentle spectral filtering helps achieve high purity. This study will pave the way for developing practical quantum sources for quantum information applications at the telecom O-band.
